## Summary

A results-oriented systems/DevOps engineer with practical expertise developing dependable, secure, and expandable cloud structures. Everything I come into contact with is automated, including data-driven processes using Python/PowerShell, comprehensive CI/CD using GitLab and Jenkins, and infrastructure provisioning using Terraform. Clear documentation, measurable impact, and clean pipelines are important to me.
