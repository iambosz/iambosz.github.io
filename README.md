## Summary

DevOps / System engineer with hands-on experience designing, operating, and automating Azure platforms at scale. I build reliable and secure cloud infrastructure with Terraform, manage infrastrictire,DNS and networking for large environments, and deliver end-to-end CI/CD with GitLab and Jenkins. I focus on cost visibility, security, and reducing manual work through automation in Python and PowerShell, and I write clear documentation so application teams can use these tools independently.
